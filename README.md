# NFL Big Data Bowl 2023
Project by Sam Oliver

## Overview
The National Football League (NFL) is back with another Big Data Bowl, where contestants use Next Gen Stats player tracking data to generate actionable, creative, and novel stats. Previous iterations have considered running backs, defensive backs, and special teams, and have generated metrics that have been used on television and by NFL teams.

## 2023 Theme: Linemen on Pass Plays
Quarterbacks may get the glory, but some of the most important work takes place a few feet in front of them. The offensive line protects the passer, providing precious seconds to find receivers downfield. At the same time, the opposing team’s defensive line attempts to find a disruptive path. If a defender sneaks through, it can mean a sack, a blocked pass, or even a turnover. Some of the game’s most important plays happen on the line and this competition examines the data behind the hardest workers in football.

## New Metric Proposal: Distance Denied to the Passer

In this competition, you’ll have access to the NFL’s Next Gen Stats data, including player tracking, play, game, and player information, as well as Pro Football Focus (PFF) scouting data for 2021 passing plays (Weeks 1-8 of the NFL season). You’ll create new metrics and stats for America's most popular sports league. Notebook submissions will be scored based on five components: innovation, accuracy, relevance, clarity, and data visualization.

Winners will be invited to present their results to the NFL, where one competition team will receive an additional prize. The most useful new metrics or analysis could be also used by NFL teams to evaluate their offensive and defensive lines.
